      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world. It is really
        important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around him or her. I have been
        coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my knowlegde, creativity, math and
        confidence.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>Skills are a important aspect of a person's career as they define
        your ability in your domain. In my opinion, with skills and knowledge, socializing
        is also and important aspect. Throughout my academic career, I have joined a lot of clubs
        and organizations for improving my self confidence, public speaking and networking.
        Technical as well as Non- technical knowledge are important when it comes to thriving
        in the society. Here are a few of my skills and the organizations that I have
        joined uptil now.</p>
